### **1. Understand the Basics of Game Engines**

Learn about the core components of a game engine and how they interact. Focus on:

- **Rendering**: Drawing graphics on the screen.
- **Physics**: Simulating movement, collisions, and interactions.
- **Input Handling**: Managing user inputs like keyboard, mouse, and controller events.
- **Audio**: Playing background music, sound effects, etc.
- **Scene Management**: Managing objects, levels, or scenes in the game.
- **Scripting**: Allowing game-specific logic (e.g., Lua, or in your case, potentially embedding Rust scripting).

#### **Action Plan:**

- Read articles or watch videos on **how game engines work**.
    - Suggested resources:
        - [Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)
        - YouTube channels like The Cherno, Game Dev Academy, etc.
- Play with open-source game engines like **Godot**, **Bevy** (Rust-based), or **Unity** to understand how they function.

### **2. Learn Game Development Basics**

Before diving into engine development, learn the fundamental principles of game development:

- **Game Loops**: Continuous loops that update the game state and render it.
- **Entity-Component-System (ECS)**: A common architecture for managing game objects.
- **Math for Games**: Basics of linear algebra, vectors, and transformations (e.g., scaling, rotating, and translating objects).

#### **Action Plan:**

- Study game loops and ECS architecture.
    - Implement a simple game in Rust using **ggez** or **Bevy**.
- Learn game development math using books like **3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development**.
- Practice creating a simple game like Pong or Breakout.

---

### **3. Explore Game Development Libraries in Rust**

Familiarize yourself with Rust libraries for game development to build foundational knowledge:

- **winit**: For window creation and event handling.
- **wgpu**: A low-level graphics API used for rendering.
- **Bevy**: A data-driven game engine written in Rust.
- **Legion** or **hecs**: Popular ECS libraries.

#### **Action Plan:**

- Create a basic program that opens a window and handles user input using **winit**.
- Render basic shapes with **wgpu**.
- Build a simple ECS system using **Legion**.

### **4. Start Building Your Game Engine**

With a basic understanding, start building your own engine. Take it step by step:

1. **Rendering**: Start with 2D rendering.
    - Load and display sprites.
    - Render simple animations.
    - Handle a camera system.
2. **Input Handling**: Capture keyboard and mouse input.
3. **Entity-Component-System**: Implement a lightweight ECS to manage game objects.
4. **Physics**: Add collision detection and simple physics.
5. **Audio**: Integrate an audio library (e.g., rodio).
6. **Scene Management**: Allow switching between game states like menu, gameplay, etc.

#### **Action Plan:**

- Work on one module at a time.
- Use open-source projects (like Bevy or Amethyst) as references.

---

### **5. Learn Advanced Topics**

Once you have a basic engine running, explore more advanced topics:

- **3D Rendering**: Learn about shaders, 3D models, and lighting.

### **1. Create a Window and Handle Input**

#### Goal:

- Open a window.
- Capture basic input like key presses and mouse movements.

#### Tools:

- **winit**: For window management and input handling.

#### Tasks:

1. Create a simple window using `winit`.
2. Handle user inputs like pressing `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys or moving the mouse.

#### Example:

```rust
use winit::{
    event::{Event, WindowEvent, KeyboardInput, VirtualKeyCode},
    event_loop::{ControlFlow, EventLoop},
    window::WindowBuilder,
};

fn main() {
    let event_loop = EventLoop::new();
    let window = WindowBuilder::new()
        .with_title("Game Engine Window")
        .build(&event_loop)
        .unwrap();

    event_loop.run(move |event, _, control_flow| {
        *control_flow = ControlFlow::Wait;

        match event {
            Event::WindowEvent { event, .. } => match event {
                WindowEvent::CloseRequested => {
                    *control_flow = ControlFlow::Exit;
                }
                WindowEvent::KeyboardInput { input, .. } => {
                    if let Some(VirtualKeyCode::Escape) = input.virtual_keycode {
                        *control_flow = ControlFlow::Exit;
                    }
                }
                _ => {}
            },
            _ => {}
        }
    });
}
```

#### Outcome:

You’ll understand how to manage a window and capture user input events.

---

### **2. Render Basic Shapes**

#### Goal:

- Draw simple shapes like a rectangle or circle in the window.

#### Tools:

- **wgpu**: For low-level graphics rendering.

#### Tasks:

1. Initialize a **wgpu** instance.
2. Render a colored triangle or rectangle to the screen.

#### Example:

- Follow a tutorial like [wgpu-rs examples](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs).

---

### **3. Add a Game Loop**

#### Goal:

- Create a continuous loop to update and render your game.

#### Tasks:

1. Define an update function for game logic.
2. Define a render function for graphics.
3. Create a loop that calls these functions.

#### Example Structure:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut is_running = true;

    while is_running {
        // Update game logic
        update();

        // Render frame
        render();

        // Exit condition (temporary)
        if user_requested_exit() {
            is_running = false;
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **4. Implement a Simple ECS**

#### Goal:

- Create a basic **Entity-Component-System** (ECS) to manage game objects.

#### Tasks:

1. Define entities (e.g., an ID for each game object).
2. Create components (e.g., position, velocity).
3. Build a system to update components (e.g., move entities based on velocity).

#### Example:

```rust
struct Position {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
}

struct Velocity {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut positions = vec![Position { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }];
    let velocities = vec![Velocity { x: 1.0, y: 1.5 }];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        // Update positions
        for (pos, vel) in positions.iter_mut().zip(&velocities) {
            pos.x += vel.x;
            pos.y += vel.y;
        }

        // Print updated positions
        println!("{:?}", positions);
    }
}
```

#### Outcome:

You’ll understand the basics of managing game objects and their properties.

---

### **5. Load and Display a Texture**

#### Goal:

- Load a sprite (e.g., PNG image) and display it in the window.

#### Tools:

- **image** crate: To load image files.
- **wgpu** or **ggez**: To render the texture.

#### Tasks:

1. Load a sprite image.
2. Bind it as a texture in your graphics pipeline.
3. Render the texture to the screen.

---

### **6. Simple Collision Detection**

#### Goal:

- Detect and respond to collisions between objects.

#### Tasks:

1. Implement axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) collision detection.
2. Update the position of entities based on collision outcomes.

#### Example:

```rust
fn check_collision(a: &Position, b: &Position, size: f32) -> bool {
    (a.x - b.x).abs() < size && (a.y - b.y).abs() < size
}
```

---

### **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Research**:
    - Look up tutorials on **wgpu** and **winit**.
    - Study ECS patterns (e.g., Bevy's implementation for inspiration).
2. **Code**:
    - Start with a window and rendering basic shapes.
    - Add simple input handling and game logic.
3. **Experiment**:
    - Gradually build features like textures, collisions, and a game loop.
