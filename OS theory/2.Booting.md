# What Runs First ?
- BootLoader
	- A Program that loads a bigger program (eg. the OS)
	- when bootloader finishes loading the OS , it transfers the control .

# Intel / AMD pc startup 
- CPU reset at startup
- start execution at 0xffffffff0
- JMP instruction to BIOS CODE in non-volatile memory
- Processor starts in REAL MODE
	- 20-bit address space 
	- Direct access to I/O, interrups , and memory.

## What is the Master Boot Record (MBR)?

The Master Boot Record (MBR) is the information in the first sector of a [hard disk](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/hard-disk-drive) or a [removable drive](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatabackup/definition/removable-media). It identifies how and where the system's operating system ([OS](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/operating-system-OS)) is located in order to be booted (loaded) into the computer's main storage or random access memory ([RAM](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/RAM-random-access-memory)).

The MBR also includes a program that reads the boot sector record of the [partition](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/partition) containing the OS to be booted. In turn, that record contains a program that loads the rest of the OS into RAM.
# Booting windows
- The BIOS doest not the file systems but can read the disk blocks (coz file system is know by os but bootloader is loaded before the os)
- MBR: Block 0 of disk (512bytes) -> first 512 bytes of that drive
	- Small boot loader (chain loader, <= 440 bytes)
	- Disk Signature (4bytes)
	- Disk partition table (16bytes per partition * 4)
- Bios firmware loads and executes the contents of the MBR
- MBR code scnas through partition table and loads the VBR volume boot record for that partition


# UEFI
Forget about stage 1 and stage 2 just let the BIOS load what ever the OS is,

UEFI, or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, is ==a software interface that connects a computer's operating system with its hardware components==. UEFI is a modern replacement for the traditional BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) firmware. UEFI has several advantages over BIOS, including:

- **Faster boot times**: UEFI offers faster boot times than BIOS.
- **Improved security**: UEFI has improved security features compared to BIOS.
- **Larger storage devices**: UEFI supports larger storage devices than BIOS.

- **User-friendly interface**: UEFI has a more user-friendly interface than BIOS. 
- Preserved from BIOS:
	- Power management (Advance configuration and power interface ACPI)
	- system management components from the bios.    

UEFI's primary role is to facilitate the boot process. The boot process involves the following stages:

- UEFI firmware initializes the hardware components.

- UEFI loads the boot manager.

- UEFI loads the operating system's bootloader and transfers control to it.

# EFI BOOTING
- No need for MBR code (ignore block 0)
- Read GUID partition Table (GPT)
	- describes the layout of the partition table on a disk ( blocks 1-33)
- EFI undrstands the FAT file systems
	- apples EFI knows HFS+ in additon
