```c
//weekmain.c
#include<stdio.h>

void f();
char x = 'a';
char y = 'b';

int main(){
	f();
	printf("%c%c\n",y,x);
	return 0;
}
```
.
```c
//weeklib.c
int x;
void f(){
	x = 0x3b29;
}
```
OUTPUT
```c
;)    //whattttttttttt how???
```

lets look at the memory
```
LVALUES | RVALUES
0x1 - 97 'a'
0x2 - 98 'b'
0x3 - 0
0x4 - 0
```
But after the fn is called and the x is set to be an integer , all x will be consider as 4 bytes coz its an int.
```
LVALUES | RVALUES
0x1 - 29
0x2 - 4b
0x3 - 0
0x4 - 0
```

```

# Address space layout in unix systems
Address Space Layout (ASL) refers to the organization of memory regions in a process's address space. In a computer program, the address space is a range of memory addresses that the operating system allocates to the program to use for its code, data, and runtime needs. The layout determines how various components of the program are arranged in memory

```
+--------------------+ High memory addresses
|      Stack         |
|--------------------|
|      Reserved      |
|--------------------|
| Shared Libraries   |
|--------------------|
|        Heap        |
|--------------------|
|   Uninitialized    |
|      (BSS)         |
|--------------------|
|   Initialized Data |
|--------------------|
|      Code (Text)   |
+--------------------+ Low memory addresses

```

# ASLR
**Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)** is a security feature that introduces randomness into the address space layout of a process. It makes it more difficult for attackers to predict the location of specific regions in memory, such as the stack, heap, shared libraries, or executable code, thereby mitigating attacks like buffer overflows or return-oriented programming (ROP).
### **Challenges of ASLR**

1. **Performance Overhead**:
    
    - Minimal but present due to the need for address randomization at runtime.
2. **Partial Bypass**:
    
    - If an attacker gains some information about memory layout (e.g., through an information leak), ASLR may be partially defeated.
3. **Disabled in Some Environments**:
    
    - Certain systems (e.g., embedded or real-time systems) may not enable ASLR due to constraints or performance concerns.

**Without ASLR**
```
+--------------------+ High memory addresses
|      Stack         | <- Fixed base address
|--------------------|
|      Reserved      |
|--------------------|
| Shared Libraries   | <- Fixed base address
|--------------------|
|        Heap        | <- Fixed base address

|--------------------|
|   Initialized Data | <- Fixed base address
|--------------------|

With ASLR
