#### **1. Symbol Resolution**

Symbol resolution is the process where a **linker** or **loader** identifies the memory address or location of a symbol (like a variable, function, or object) used in the program.
```c
// File1.c
void foo(); // Declaration

int main() {
    foo();  // Symbol 'foo' must be resolved.
}

// File2.c
void foo() {
    // Symbol 'foo' definition
}

```
When linking, `foo()` in `File1.o` will be resolved to its definition in `File2.o`.

#### **2. Symbol Relocation**

Symbol relocation is the process of adjusting addresses of symbols when the actual memory location is determined at **link time** or **load time**.
##### Why Relocation is Necessary:

1. **Position-Independent Code**:
    
    - Functions and variables in a program cannot always be placed at fixed memory addresses.
    - Relocation ensures symbols are adjusted to their final locations.
2. **Dynamic Libraries**:
    
    - Shared libraries are loaded into different memory locations at runtime, and their symbols must be relocated accordingly.


#### **Symbol Resolution vs. Relocation**


|Aspect|Symbol Resolution|Symbol Relocation|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Match a symbol's usage to its definition.|Adjust addresses of symbols during linking/loading.|
|**Phase**|Happens during linking.|Happens during linking or runtime.|
|**Output**|Resolves undefined symbols.|Ensures symbols are at correct addresses.|

system code will also have \_start function.
\_start will call the main.
```c
_start{
	main()
}
```
### Symbol Table
A **symbol table** is a data structure used in **compilers, linkers**, and **assemblers** to store information about the symbols in a program. Symbols can include variables, functions, classes, and objects. The symbol table plays a critical role in **symbol resolution**, **relocation**, and other stages of program compilation and linking.

```c
int globalVar = 5;

void foo() {
    int localVar = 10;
}

```

|Symbol Name|Type|Scope|Memory Location|Size|Additional Info|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|`globalVar`|`int`|Global|`0x1000`|`4`|Initialized to `5`|
|`foo`|`void`|Global|`0x2000`|N/A|Function|
|`localVar`|`int`|Local|`0x3000`|`4`|Visible only in `foo`|
