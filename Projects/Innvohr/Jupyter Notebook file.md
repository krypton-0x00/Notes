1. Database Setup and Structure:

- Creates a MySQL database named "amelio"
- Creates two tables:
    - `hr_policy`: Stores basic policy information (id, policy_name)
    - `hr_policy_type`: Stores policy types (id, policy_type) with a foreign key link to hr_policy

- Inserts multiple policy types related to the remote policy:
    - Flexible
    - non-flexible
    - onsite

3. PDF Generation:

        - Flexible hours
        - Remote work
        - Compressed workweek
