The store instruction follows a format similar to the load instruction in terms of binary encoding, but with some key differences. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **Register-Type Store Instruction:**
    
    - The register-type store instruction has the same binary structure as the load instruction.
    - The **destination register** in the instruction specifies the register holding the **destination memory address** where the data will be stored.
    - The **source register** specifies the register containing the **data** that needs to be stored in the memory.
2. **Immediate-Type Store Instruction:**
    
    - In the immediate-type store instruction, the memory address is explicitly given as an **8-bit immediate value** in the second byte, specifying the address where the data will be stored.

### Example Instructions and Their Binary Encoding:

- **Load 12, A** (Immediate Type):
    
    - Mode bit = 1 (indicating an immediate-type instruction)
    - Opcode for load = `010`
    - Register A = `00`
    - Immediate value = `12` (represented as `00001100` in 8-bit binary)
    - Complete binary encoding: `1 010 00 00 00001100`
- **Store C12, #14** (Immediate Type):
    
    - Mode bit = 1 (indicating an immediate-type instruction)
    - Opcode for store = `011`
    - Register C (source data) = `10`
    - Destination address = `14` (represented as `00001110` in 8-bit binary)
    - Since no explicit destination register is used, it is set to `00`.
    - Complete binary encoding: `1 011 10 00 00001110`

### Key Points:

- The **store instruction** stores data from a register into a memory location.
- The **load instruction** loads data from a memory location into a register.
- Immediate values directly encode constants (e.g., memory addresses or data) within the instruction.
