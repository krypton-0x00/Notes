**Relative addressing** is a mode of addressing in computer architecture where the effective address of an operand is determined by adding an offset (or displacement) to a base address, such as the current value of the program counter (PC) or another register. This addressing mode is widely used in assembly language and machine code for tasks like branching, accessing data, or executing subroutines.

### **Key Features of Relative Addressing**

1. **Offset/Displacement**:
    
    - The instruction contains a value (positive or negative) that represents the offset relative to a base address (e.g., the program counter).
    - The effective address = base address (e.g., current PC) + offset.
2. **Program Counter (PC)**:
    
    - Often, the base address used in relative addressing is the value of the PC. This makes it convenient for specifying addresses near the current instruction.
3. **Compact Instructions**:
    
    - Since only the offset is stored in the instruction, it requires fewer bits compared to storing a full absolute address.
4. **Flexibility**:
    
    - Allows for position-independent code, making programs relocatable in memory without requiring modifications to the instruction addresses.

### **Examples**

#### 1. **Branching**:

```assembly
BEQ R1, R2, LABEL
```

- **BEQ**: Branch if equal.
- The processor checks if the contents of `R1` and `R2` are equal.
- If true, the program counter (PC) jumps to `LABEL`, calculated as `PC + offset`.

#### 2. **Memory Access**:

```assembly
MOV R1, [R2 + OFFSET]
```

- Accesses memory at an address relative to the value in `R2` by adding the `OFFSET`.

### **Applications**

1. **Branching and Loops**:
    
    - Relative addressing is commonly used in conditional and unconditional branching instructions to specify the target of a jump relative to the current PC.
2. **Position-Independent Code**:
    
    - Useful in dynamic libraries or code designed to run at different memory locations without modification.
3. **Efficient Instruction Encoding**:
    
    - Reduces instruction size by avoiding the need for large absolute addresses.

### **Advantages**

- **Compact Encoding**: Saves memory and bandwidth by using smaller offsets instead of full addresses.
- **Relocatability**: Facilitates moving code segments in memory without requiring address adjustments.
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Enables loops, jumps, and conditional branches efficiently.

### **Disadvantages**

- **Limited Range**: Offset size restricts how far you can branch or access memory relative to the base address.
- **Complexity**: Requires runtime calculation of the effective address, potentially adding a small overhead.

### **Example with Numbers**

Assume:

- Current **PC** = 1000.
- Instruction: `JMP +30`.

The processor computes the target address as: TargetÂ Address=PC+Offset=1000+30=1030\text{Target Address} = \text{PC} + \text{Offset} = 1000 + 30 = 1030

Here, the instruction tells the CPU to jump to address 1030 relative to the current PC.
