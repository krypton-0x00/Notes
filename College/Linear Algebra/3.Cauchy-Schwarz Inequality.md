### **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

The **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality** is a fundamental result in vector algebra. It provides an upper bound for the absolute value of the dot product of two vectors in terms of their magnitudes.

#### **Statement**

For any two vectors a\mathbf{a} and b\mathbf{b}:

# $|a . b| <= |a||b|$

This means the absolute value of the dot product of two vectors is **always less than or equal to the product of their magnitudes**.

The equality holds if and only if a and b are linearly dependent (i.e., one vector is a scalar multiple of the other).

### **Geometric Interpretation**

The inequality can be seen as a restriction on the relationship between the dot product and the cosine of the angle between the vectors:

### **Why Does This Matter?**

The inequality sets a limit: the dot product can't exceed the product of the vector lengths. This is because the dot product depends on the angle θ between the two vectors, and the cosine function cos⁡θ is always between **−1 and 1.

- If the vectors are parallel (point in the same direction), the dot product equals the product of the magnitudes:  
    # $|a.b| = |a||b|$
	$(cos θ = 1)$    

- If the vectors are perpendicular, the dot product is ):  
    $|a⋅b∣= 0$
    $(cos⁡θ=0)$
