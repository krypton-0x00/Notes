The **Triangle Inequality** is a fundamental property of distances in geometry. It states that for any three points A, B, and C, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side. In the context of vectors, it can be written as:

# $||a+b|| <= ||a||+||b||$
ie: Magnitude of vect sum $<=$  Magnitudes of the vectors

# Distance Bw Two Vectors
The **distance** between two vectors a and b is simply the length of the vector from a to b, and it's calculated using the **Euclidean distance** formula:


# $d (\vec a, \vec b) = ||\vec a - \vec b||$

Where: 
$\vec a - \vec b$  is the vector difference bw the two vectors.
$||\vec a - \vec b||$ is the magnitude of that vector difference


# EXAMPLE
For two vectors $\vec a , \vec b$  in 3 dimensional space the distance is: 

# $d(a,b) =  \sqrt{(a1-b1)^2+(a2-b2)^2+(a3-b3)^2}$


# Angle Btw two vectors
The **angle** between two vectors $\vec{a}$  and $\vec b$ can be found using the **dot product** formula:

# $cos(\theta) = \frac{\vec a . \vec b} {||\vec a||||\vec b||}$

The **angle** between two vectors aand b can be found using the **dot product** formula:


to find the angle $\theta$ :

# $\theta =cos^{-1} ( \frac{\vec a . \vec b} {||\vec a||||\vec b||} )$
