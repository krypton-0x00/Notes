 All Binary Machine code is not related to arthimic operations some of them are machine instructions but how does the cpu knows that
	well:
	- if the first 2 bits of the instruction are zeros the computer interprets them as arthimic operation instructions.

# Type of Operations
The 3rd and the 4th bits determine the type of operation
