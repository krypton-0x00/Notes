A **singleton** is a design pattern in software engineering used to ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global point of access to that instance. This can be useful when only one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as in scenarios like logging, managing configurations, or accessing shared resources.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Singleton {
private:
    static Singleton* instance;  // Static pointer to the single instance
    Singleton() {}  // Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation

public:
    // Static method to provide global access to the instance
    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        if (instance == nullptr) {  // If no instance exists, create one
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    void showMessage() {
        std::cout << "Singleton instance address: " << this << std::endl;
    }
};

// Initialize the static member (singleton instance pointer)
Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr;

int main() {
    // Access Singleton instance
    Singleton* s1 = Singleton::getInstance();
    s1->showMessage();

    Singleton* s2 = Singleton::getInstance();
    s2->showMessage();

    // Verify that both s1 and s2 point to the same instance
    std::cout << "Are both instances equal? " << (s1 == s2 ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

```
```output 
Singleton instance address: 0x55b1a1f35c90
Singleton instance address: 0x55b1a1f35c90
Are both instances equal? Yes


```
### Explanation:

1. **Private Constructor**: The constructor of the `Singleton` class is private to prevent external instantiation.
2. **Static Member (`instance`)**: A static pointer (`instance`) holds the single instance of the class.
3. **`getInstance` Method**: This is a static method that checks if the instance already exists. If not, it creates a new instance and returns it.
4. **Same Instance**: Both `s1` and `s2` point to the same instance, ensuring only one instance of the class exists.
