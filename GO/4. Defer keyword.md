The `defer` statement in Go is used to schedule a function call to be executed later, usually when the surrounding function returns. It's often used for cleaning up resources like closing files, releasing locks, or freeing memory.

### `defer` in Action

In your example, `defer file.Close()` ensures that the file is closed once the `main` function completes, regardless of whether the function exits normally or due to an error. This helps to prevent resource leaks by guaranteeing that the file is always closed properly.

### How It Works:

- **When the `defer` statement is encountered**, the function call (`file.Close()` in this case) is not executed immediately. Instead, it is "deferred" until the surrounding function (`main()` in your example) is about to return.
- **Deferred calls are executed in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order**. If you have multiple `defer` statements, the last one will be executed first when the function exits.

### Example Breakdown:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    file, err := os.Open("somefile.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
        return
    }
    
    // This schedules the file to be closed when `main()` exits
    defer file.Close()
    
    // Do work with the file...
    fmt.Println("File opened successfully")

    // The file will be automatically closed when the function exits.
}
```

### Why Use `defer` for `file.Close()`?

1. **Safety and Readability:** The `defer` statement ensures that the file is closed, even if an error occurs in the middle of your function. Without `defer`, you would need to manually call `file.Close()` at the end of every exit path in the function, which is error-prone and less readable.
    
2. **Handling Multiple Resources:** If your function works with multiple resources (e.g., files, network connections, locks), using `defer` for cleanup helps ensure they are all released in the correct order when the function finishes execution.
    

### Example with Multiple `defer` Calls:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    file1, err := os.Open("file1.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error opening file1:", err)
        return
    }
    defer file1.Close()

    file2, err := os.Open("file2.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error opening file2:", err)
        return
    }
    defer file2.Close()

    fmt.Println("Both files opened successfully")
}
```

- Both `file1.Close()` and `file2.Close()` are deferred, so they will be called when the `main` function exits, regardless of how it exits.

### Notes:

- **Deferred function calls are executed even if there’s a `panic`**. If an error or panic occurs in the function, `defer` ensures that resources are cleaned up properly.
- **`defer` incurs a slight performance cost** due to bookkeeping, but it’s usually negligible compared to the safety and clarity it provides, especially in resource-heavy operations like file I/O.

In summary, `defer file.Close()` is an elegant way to ensure resources like files are cleaned up automatically at the end of a function, promoting safe and readable code.
