The issue with the tuple code in Listing 4-5 is that we have to return the String to the calling function so we can still use the String after the call to calculate_length, because the String was moved into calculate_length. Instead, we can provide a reference to the String value. A reference is like a pointer in that it’s an address we can follow to access the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable. Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference.Here is how you would define and use a calculate_length function that has a reference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the value:Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{s1}' is {len}.");
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

#Note: The opposite of referencing by using `&` is _de referencing_, which is accomplished with the de reference operator, `*`.

Let’s take a closer look at the function call here

```rust
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

```
**The `&s1` syntax** lets us create a reference that _refers_ to the value of `s1` but does not own it. Because it does not own it, the value it points to will not be dropped when the reference stops being used.

Likewise, the signature of the function uses `&` to indicate that the type of the parameter `s` is a reference. Let’s add some explanatory annotations:
```rust
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, it is not dropped.
```
  
The scope in which the variable `s` is valid is the same as any function parameter’s scope, but the value pointed to by the reference is not dropped when `s` stops being used, because `s` doesn’t have ownership. When functions have references as parameters instead of the actual values, we won’t need to return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had ownership.

We call the action of creating a reference _borrowing_. As in real life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you’re done, you have to give it back. You don’t own it.
# References are immutable by default 
```rust
fn main() {
    let  s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}

Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We’re not allowed to modify something we have a reference to
### [Mutable References](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#mutable-references)
```rust 
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```
First we change `s` to be `mut`. Then we create a mutable reference with `&mut s` where we call the `change` function, and update the function signature to accept a mutable reference with `some_string: &mut String`. This makes it very clear that the `change` function will mutate the value it borrows.

#note: Mutable references have one big restriction: if you have a mutable reference to a value, you can have no other references to that value. This code that attempts to create two mutable references to `s` will fail:

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s;

    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);

```
Here’s the error:
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
 --> src/main.rs:5:14
  |
4 |     let r1 = &mut s;
  |              ------ first mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &mut s;
  |              ^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
6 |
7 |     println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
  |                        -- first borrow later used here

 

This error says that this code is invalid because we cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time. The first mutable borrow is in `r1` and must last until it’s used in the `println!`, but between the creation of that mutable reference and its usage, we tried to create another mutable reference in `r2` that borrows the same data as `r1`.

The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can prevent data races at compile time. A _data race_ is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:

- Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
- At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
- There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

#note:- These Prevent Race Conditions.
# Fix
As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references, just not _simultaneous_ ones:

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &mut s;

```

Rust enforces a similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references. This code results in an error:


```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

    println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);

```

### [Dangling References](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#dangling-references)

In languages with pointers, it’s easy to erroneously create a _dangling pointer_—a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else—by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory. In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references: if you have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.

Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int* ptr = new int(5);  // Dynamically allocate memory for an integer
    std::cout << *ptr << std::endl;  // Prints 5

    delete ptr;  // Free the memory

    // Now ptr is a dangling pointer; it still holds the address of the deallocated memory
    std::cout << *ptr << std::endl;  // Undefined behavior, might crash or print garbage

    return 0;
}


```

 


Let’s try to create a dangling reference to see how Rust prevents them with a compile-time error:

Filename: src/main.rs
```rust
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    &s
}
```

```

This error message refers to a feature we haven’t covered yet: lifetimes. We’ll discuss lifetimes in detail in Chapter 10. But, if you disregard the parts about lifetimes, the message does contain the key to why this code is a problem:

`this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value
for it to be borrowed from`

Let’s take a closer look at exactly what’s happening at each stage of our `dangle` code:

```rust
fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!
```
Because `s` is created inside `dangle`, when the code of `dangle` is finished, `s` will be deallocated. But we tried to return a reference to it. That means this reference would be pointing to an invalid `String`. That’s no good! Rust won’t let us do this.

The solution here is to return the `String` directly:

```rust
fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    s
}
```

This works without any problems. Ownership is moved out, and nothing is deallocated.

### [The Rules of References](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#the-rules-of-references)

Let’s recap what we’ve discussed about references:

- At any given time, you can have _either_ one mutable reference _or_ any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.

Next, we’ll look at a different kind of reference: slices.



# if you have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.
So, once the data goes out of scope, any references to it are no longer valid, and the compiler prevents you from using them.
