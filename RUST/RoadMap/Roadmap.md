### **Rust Roadmap**

---

#### 1. **Getting Started with Rust**

**Key Topics:**

- Setting up the Rust environment (Rustup, Cargo, Crates.io)
- Writing and running the first Rust program
- Understanding `cargo`, the Rust package manager

**Project:**

- **"Hello, Rust!"**: Write a simple program that takes user input and prints a message.

---

#### 2. **Understanding the Rust Syntax**

**Key Topics:**

- Variables and Mutability
- Data Types (Primitive types, tuples, arrays)
- Functions and Control Flow (if, match, loops)
- Comments and Documentation

**Project:**

- **Basic Calculator**: Create a command-line calculator that takes basic math operations as input and returns the result.

---

#### 3. **Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes** (Core Concept)

**Key Topics:**

- Ownership Rules
- Borrowing & Mutable Borrowing
- Lifetimes and their importance
- Stack vs. Heap memory management

**Project:**

- **Memory Game**: Implement a simple game where players guess a sequence of numbers. Use ownership and borrowing to manage the sequence.

---

#### 4. **Data Structures and Enums**

**Key Topics:**

- Structs and methods
- Enums and Pattern Matching
- Option and Result types (for error handling)

**Project:**

- **To-Do List**: Implement a CLI to-do list where tasks can be added, removed, and updated. Use enums to model task states (e.g., In-progress, Completed, etc.).

---

#### 5. **Error Handling**

**Key Topics:**

- Unrecoverable Errors with `panic!`
- Recoverable Errors with `Result` and `Option`
- Propagating Errors (`?` operator)

**Project:**

- **File Reader Tool**: Build a simple program that reads from a file and handles errors if the file is missing or corrupted.

---

#### 6. **Collections and Iterators**

**Key Topics:**

- Vectors, HashMaps, and Strings
- Using Iterators and Closures
- Methods for Transforming Collections

**Project:**

- **Shopping Cart**: Build a shopping cart system that stores items in a vector, calculates the total, and applies discounts.

---

#### 7. **Traits and Generics**

**Key Topics:**

- Defining and Implementing Traits
- Trait Bounds
- Generics for Reusable Code

**Project:**

- **Sorting Algorithm**: Implement a generic sorting function using traits. Try implementing bubble sort or insertion sort for different data types.

---

#### 8. **Concurrency in Rust**

**Key Topics:**

- Threads and Message Passing
- Shared-State Concurrency
- The `Send` and `Sync` Traits

**Project:**

- **Multithreaded Web Scraper**: Create a simple web scraper that fetches data from multiple websites concurrently using threads.

---

#### 9. **Asynchronous Programming**

**Key Topics:**

- Async/Await Syntax
- Futures and Tasks
- Working with async libraries (Tokio, async-std)

**Project:**

- **Async HTTP Client**: Build an asynchronous HTTP client that fetches data from an API and displays it in a user-friendly format.

---

#### 10. **Smart Pointers and Memory Management**

**Key Topics:**

- Box, Rc, Arc, and RefCell
- Deref and Drop Traits
- Custom Smart Pointers

**Project:**

- **Custom Linked List**: Build a linked list from scratch using Rustâ€™s smart pointers, handling memory and ownership manually.

---

#### 11. **Advanced Error Handling**

**Key Topics:**

- Custom Error Types
- Error Handling Patterns (e.g., the `thiserror` and `anyhow` crates)

**Project:**

- **Command-line Tool**: Create a CLI tool that handles multiple types of errors, such as incorrect user input, file reading issues, and network problems.

---

#### 12. **Macros and Metaprogramming**

**Key Topics:**

- Declarative Macros (`macro_rules!`)
- Procedural Macros
- Code Generation

**Project:**

- **Custom DSL**: Build a domain-specific language (DSL) for a specific task, like generating code for a mini templating engine.

---

#### 13. **Networking and Web Development**

**Key Topics:**

- Using Crates like `reqwest`, `hyper`, or `warp` for HTTP
- Basic REST API with Rocket or Actix-web
- WebSocket and Async I/O

**Project:**

- **Simple Web Server**: Build a simple web server that serves static HTML files and handles basic routing with Actix or Rocket.

---

#### 14. **Interfacing with C and FFI**

**Key Topics:**

- Foreign Function Interface (FFI)
- Calling Rust from C and vice versa
- Unsafe Rust

**Project:**

- **C-Rust Hybrid Library**: Create a small library in Rust that exposes functions to be used in a C program.

---

#### 15. **WebAssembly with Rust**

**Key Topics:**

- Introduction to WebAssembly (WASM)
- Compiling Rust to WASM
- Rust and JavaScript Interoperability

**Project:**

- **WASM Game**: Build a small game using Rust and compile it to WebAssembly to run in the browser.

---

### **Bonus Section: Contributing to the Rust Ecosystem**

**Goal**: Start contributing to open-source projects or creating your own libraries (crates) for the Rust ecosystem.

**Resources**:

- Explore open-source Rust projects on GitHub
- Join the Rust community for mentorship
- Publish a crate to [Crates.io](https://crates.io/)
