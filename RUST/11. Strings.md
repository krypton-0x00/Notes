**UTF-8** = can be 1 to 4 bytes
ie. 1112064 characters!

Text in rust is also encoded in utf-8


eg: Crab emoji looks something like this in UTF-8

11110000 10011111 10100110 1000000
First for 1111s represent its taking 4 bytes



### Rust has two string types

![[Pasted image 20240907175911.png]]

**String** (Owned, growable, and heap-allocated):

- This type is a growable, mutable, heap-allocated string.
- It is an owned type, meaning it owns the underlying memory, and you can modify or append to it.
- Example:
```rust
let mut s = String::from("Hello");
s.push_str(", world!");
println!("{}", s); // Output: Hello, world!

```
**&str** (String slice or borrowed string):

- This type is an immutable, borrowed reference to a sequence of UTF-8 bytes.
- It represents a string slice that usually refers to part of or an entire string stored elsewhere (like a `String` or string literal).
- Example:
```rust
let s: &str = "Hello, world!"; // string slice (borrowed, immutable)
println!("{}", s);

```
In short:

- `String`: Owned, growable, mutable.
- `&str`: Borrowed, fixed-length, immutable.
- ### **Memory Representation**:

- `str` is essentially a sequence of UTF-8 bytes, but because its length is not embedded in the type itself, it cannot be stored or manipulated directly.
- `&str` (a string slice) includes both a pointer to the start of the data and the length of the string, which allows Rust to handle it efficiently.
-
### Example Comparison:

- You cannot declare a variable of type `str` directly: 
    ```rust
    rust let s: str = "Hello"; // Error: str doesn't have a known size`
```
    
- Instead, you use `&str`:  
```rust
let s: &str = "Hello"; // Correct: borrowed string slice
```
## Creating a string
```rust 
fn main() {
    let s1: &str = "–ü—Ä–∏–≤—ñ—Ç –°–≤—ñ—Ç! ü¶Ä";
    let s2: String = String::from("–ü—Ä–∏–≤—ñ—Ç –°–≤—ñ—Ç!");
    let s3: String = "–ü—Ä–∏–≤—ñ—Ç –°–≤—ñ—Ç!".to_string();
    let s4: String = "–ü—Ä–∏–≤—ñ—Ç –°–≤—ñ—Ç!".to_owned();
    let s5: &str = &s4[..];
}


```
# Manipulating strings.
```rust
let s = "Hello";
println!("{}", s.len()); // Output: 5

//--------------------------

let s = "";
println!("{}", s.is_empty()); // Output: true

//--------------------------

let s = "Hello, world!";
println!("{}", s.contains("world")); // Output: true
//------------------------------


let s = "Hello, world!";
println!("{}", s.starts_with("Hello")); // Output: true
println!("{}", s.ends_with("world!"));  // Output: true



```
## Methods Specific to `String` (Owned)
**`push`**: Appends a character to the string.
```rust
let mut s = String::from("Hello");
s.push('!');
println!("{}", s); // Output: "Hello!"


// **`push_str`**: Appends a string slice to the string.
let mut s = String::from("Hello");
s.push_str(", world!");
println!("{}", s); // Output: "Hello, world!"

//insert char at specific index 
let mut s = String::from("Hell world!");
s.insert(4, 'o');
println!("{}", s); // Output: "Hello world!"

//**`insert_str`**: Inserts a string slice at a specific index.
let mut s = String::from("Hello !");
s.insert_str(6, "world");
println!("{}", s); // Output: "Hello world!"

//pop
let mut s = String::from("Hello!");
s.pop();
println!("{}", s); // Output: "Hello"

//clear
let mut s = String::from("Hello");
s.clear();
println!("{}", s); // Output: ""

//shortens the string using truncate
let mut s = String::from("Hello, world!");
s.truncate(5);
println!("{}", s); // Output: "Hello"



//**`reserve`**: Reserves capacity for at least the specified number of additional bytes.


let mut s = String::from("Hello");
s.reserve(10); // Reserves capacity for at least 10 additional bytes


//replace a range
let mut s = String::from("hello");
s.replace_range(..,"baz"); //replace entire string range.
println!("{}",s); //baz


//concate
let s1 = String::from("Hello");
let s2 = String::from("World");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; //move s1 to s3 then copies the contents s2 and append it to s3
//other way using format macro

let s:String = format!("{}-{}-{}",s1,s2,s3); //less effecient
let s5 = ["first","second"] = ["hello ","world"].concat(); 
let s6:&str = concat!("first","second"); //result is stirng slice





```

A final reason Rust doesn‚Äôt allow us to index into a String to get a character is that indexing operations are expected to always take constant time (O(1)). But it isn‚Äôt possible to guarantee that performance with a String, because Rust would have to walk through the contents from the beginning to the index to determine how many valid characters there were.

Accessing The Chars:
```rust 
fn main(){
	let s1:&str = "ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä";
	let s2 = s1[0] //this will give a byte trying to return a byte the crab is 4 bytes long , rust wont allow you to do that, ERROR
	let s2 = &s1[0..4]; //first crab: but here we have to be extra careful because we have to know exactly how many bytes the char is.
	//Takes linear Time O(n)

}

//each byte
for b:u8 in "hello".bytes(){
	println!("{}",b);
}
//iterating over chars
for c:char in "‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á".chars(){
	println!("{}",c);
}
//some graphine chars cant be printed


user unicode_segmentation::UnicodeSegmentation
for g:&str in "‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á".graphemes(true){
	println!("{}",g);
}
//prints all graphemes like matraaa in hindi 


//convert string slice to string
fn main(){
	let s1:&str = "hello world"; //string slice
	let s2:String = String::from("Hello world!");//string
	myfunction(s1);   // s1 is already a &str
	myfunction(&s2);  // s2 is a String, &s2 is a &String, which is coerced to &str

	//this is beacause of a feature in rust called deref coercion (derefcoversion) ie. when we pass a reference to a stirng its auto matically coversed to as string slice
}
fn myfunction(a:&str)->String { //takes string slice and returns a string.
	return format!("{}",a);
}
//**Deref Coercion in Action**: When you pass a `&String` to a function that expects a `&str`, Rust automatically applies deref coercion to convert `&String` into `&str`. This works because `String` implements the `Deref` trait, and `Deref<Target = str>` is implemented for `String`, allowing `&String` to be treated as `&str`.








```

## Bytes and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters! Oh My!
Another point about UTF-8 is that there are actually three relevant ways to look at strings from Rust‚Äôs perspective: as bytes, scalar values, and grapheme clusters (the closest thing to what we would call letters). If we look at the Hindi word ‚Äú‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§ ‚Äù written in the Devanagari script, ‡•á it is stored as a vector of u8 values that looks like this:
[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164, 224, 165, 135]
- That‚Äôs 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data. If we look at them as Unicode scalar values, which are what Rust‚Äôs char type is, those bytes look like this:
- ['‡§®', '‡§Æ', '‡§∏', '‡•ç', '‡§§', '‡•á']
- There are six char values here, but the fourth and sixth are not letters: they‚Äôre diacritics that don‚Äôt make sense on their own. Finally, if we look at them as grapheme clusters, we‚Äôd get what a person would call the four letters that make up the Hindi word:
- ["‡§®", "‡§Æ", "‡§∏‡•ç", "‡§§‡•á"]
-
