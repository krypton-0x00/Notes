## [Storing Lists of Values with Vectors](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-01-vectors.html#storing-lists-of-values-with-vectors)

The first collection type we’ll look at is `Vec<T>`, also known as a _vector_. Vectors allow you to store more than one value in a single data structure that puts all the values next to each other in memory. Vectors can only store values of the same type. They are useful when you have a list of items, such as the lines of text in a file or the prices of items in a shopping cart.
```rust
    let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();

```
- This creates an empty vector of type `i32`. Since the type cannot always be inferred by Rust, it's often necessary to explicitly define it.
    
- **Using the `vec![]` macro** to create a vector with initial values:
- 
This creates a vector with elements `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.
```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

```
### Adding Elements

Elements can be added to a vector using the `push` method
```rust
let mut v = Vec::new();
v.push(10);
v.push(20);
v.push(30);

```
Accessing Elements
```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
println!("First element: {}", v[0]);

```
## Dropping a Vector Drops Its Elements


```rust
{
 let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
 // do stuff with v
} // <- v goes out of scope and is freed here
```
# Reading Elmes
Listing 8-5 shows both methods of accessing a value in a vector, either
with indexing syntax or the get method.
```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; 
let third: &i32 = &v[2]; 
let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
```
the difference
```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let does_not_exist = &v[100];
let does_not_exist = v.get(100);

```
- When we run this code, the first [] method will cause the program to panic because it references a nonexistent element
- When the get method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it returns None without panicking


For safe access that doesn't panic, you can use get, which returns an Option:
```rust
match v.get(2) {
    Some(value) => println!("Found: {}", value),
    None => println!("Index out of bounds"),
}

```
### Iterating Over Vectors

Vectors can be iterated over using a `for` loop or iterators:

- **Immutable iteration**:
```rust
let v = vec![10, 20, 30];
for i in &v {
    println!("{}", i);
}

```
**Mutable iteration** (to modify elements):
```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
for i in &mut v {
    *i += 10;
}

```
**Ownership iteration** (taking ownership of elements):
```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
for i in v {
    println!("{}", i);
}
// Here, `v` is no longer valid after iteration.


```
### Removing Elements

You can remove elements from a vector using `pop`, which removes the last element and returns an
```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
v.pop(); // removes and returns 3


//For removing elements by index, use `remove`:
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
v.remove(1); // removes the element at index 1 (i.e., 2)

```
Slicing a Vector
```rust
let v = vec![10, 20, 30, 40];
let slice = &v[1..3]; // Slices elements from index 1 to 2 (exclusive of 3)

```
**Length**: You can get the number of elements in a vector with `.len()`:
```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
println!("Length: {}", v.len());


//check if vect is empty
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
println!("Is empty: {}", v.is_empty());

```
## Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types
```rust
enum SpreadsheetCell {
 Int(i32),
 Float(f64),
 Text(String),
}
let row = vec![
 SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
 SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
 SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
];
```
