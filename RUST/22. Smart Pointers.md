# 1. Box`<T>` vs std::unique_ptr in cpp

#### **Rust `Box<T>`**:

- Similarly, in Rust, `Box<T>` provides **heap allocation** and **exclusive ownership** of the object. When the `Box` goes out of scope, Rust automatically deallocates the object, thanks to the ownership system.
```rust
fn main() {
    let boxed = Box::new(10);  // Owning pointer
    println!("{}", boxed);  // Output: 10
    // Memory automatically deallocated when `boxed` goes out of scope
}

```
**Comparison**:

- Both `std::unique_ptr` in C++ and `Box<T>` in Rust manage exclusive ownership and deallocation.
- In Rust, you cannot accidentally use a `Box<T>` after it’s moved or goes out of scope because the borrow checker prevents such issues at compile time.


### 3. `Rc<T>` in Rust vs. `std::shared_ptr` in C++

#### **C++ `std::shared_ptr`**:

- `std::shared_ptr` in C++ allows **shared ownership** of a dynamically allocated object. Multiple `shared_ptr` instances can point to the same object, and the object is only deallocated when the last `shared_ptr` pointing to it is destroyed.
```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::shared_ptr<int> ptr1 = std::make_shared<int>(10);
    std::shared_ptr<int> ptr2 = ptr1;  // Shared ownership
    std::cout << *ptr1 << std::endl;  // Output: 10
    std::cout << *ptr2 << std::endl;  // Output: 10
    // Memory deallocated when both ptr1 and ptr2 go out of scope
}

```

#### **Rust `Rc<T>`**:

- In Rust, `Rc<T>` (Reference Counted) also provides **shared ownership** of an object. Multiple `Rc` instances can own the same value, and the value is only dropped when the last reference is gone. However, `Rc` _is ==not thread-safe==* so it is typically used in single-threaded scenarios._

```rust

use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let rc1 = Rc::new(10);
    let rc2 = Rc::clone(&rc1);  // Shared ownership
    println!("{}", rc1);  // Output: 10
    println!("{}", rc2);  // Output: 10
    // Memory deallocated when both rc1 and rc2 go out of scope
}

```
**Comparison**:

- Both `std::shared_ptr` and `Rc<T>` manage reference counting for shared ownership.
- In Rust, `Rc<T>` is explicitly not thread-safe (for thread-safe shared ownership, Rust uses `Arc<T>`), while `std::shared_ptr` can be used across threads in C++ (with locking mechanisms).


### 4. `Arc<T>` in Rust vs. `std::shared_ptr` in C++ (Thread-safe)

#### **C++ `std::shared_ptr`**:

- `std::shared_ptr` is thread-safe and can be used across threads in C++.

#### **Rust `Arc<T>`**:

- `Arc<T>` (Atomic Reference Counted) is like `Rc<T>`, but it is **thread-safe**. It can be shared between threads safely because it uses atomic operations to manage the reference count.
```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let arc1 = Arc::new(10);
    let arc2 = Arc::clone(&arc1);

    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("From thread: {}", arc2);
    });

    println!("From main: {}", arc1);
    handle.join().unwrap();
}

```
**Comparison**:

- Both `Arc<T>` in Rust and `std::shared_ptr` in C++ are thread-safe. However, `Arc<T>` explicitly handles atomic reference counting, while `std::shared_ptr` works with threads without the need for special types.

### 5. `RefCell<T>` in Rust vs. `std::shared_ptr` with `mutable` in C++

#### **C++ (Mutability in shared_ptr)**:

In C++, when using `std::shared_ptr`, you can use the `mutable` keyword to modify data even when it's shared, though this can lead to data races in multi-threaded environments.
```rust
#include <memory>
#include <iostream>

struct Data {
    mutable int value;
    Data(int v) : value(v) {}
};

int main() {
    std::shared_ptr<Data> ptr = std::make_shared<Data>(10);
    ptr->value = 20;  // Mutating the shared data
    std::cout << ptr->value << std::endl;  // Output: 20
}

```
#### **Rust `RefCell<T>`**:

- Rust’s `RefCell<T>` allows for **interior mutability**, which means you can mutate the value inside a `RefCell` even if the `RefCell` itself is immutable. `RefCell<T>` ==enforces borrowing rules at runtime==, unlike Rust's typical compile-time checks.
```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

fn main() {
    let cell = RefCell::new(10);
    *cell.borrow_mut() = 20;  // Mutating the shared data
    println!("{}", cell.borrow());  // Output: 20
}

```
**Comparison**:

- C++ allows for mutability with `mutable` and `std::shared_ptr`, but this can be dangerous in concurrent code.
- Rust's `RefCell<T>` provides a safe way to mutate data while enforcing borrowing rules at runtime. It’s useful in single-threaded contexts but not thread-safe (for thread-safe mutation, Rust provides `Mutex<T>`).
