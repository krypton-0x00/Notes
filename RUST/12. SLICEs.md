_Slices_ let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a [collection](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-00-common-collections.html) rather than the whole collection. A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.

CONVERTING SPACE TO BYTES
```rust
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    //iterating over bytes
    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {

	
```
For now, know that `iter` is a method that returns each element in a collection and that `enumerate` wraps the result of `iter` and returns each element as part of a tuple instead. The first element of the tuple returned from `enumerate` is the index, and the second element is a reference to the element. This is a bit more convenient than calculating the index ourselves.

SLICES
```rust
    let s = String::from("hello world");

    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];

```
Rather than a reference to the entire `String`, `hello` is a reference to a portion of the `String`, specified in the extra `[0..5]` bit. We create slices using a range within brackets by specifying `[starting_index..ending_index]`, where `starting_index` is the first position in the slice and `ending_index` is one more than the last position in the slice.![[trpl04-06.svg]]
With all this information in mind, let’s rewrite `first_word` to return a slice. The type that signifies “string slice” is written as `&str`:
```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes(); //convert string to bytes

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}

```
We now have a straightforward API that’s much harder to mess up because the compiler will ensure the references into the `String` remain valid. Remember the bug in the program in Listing 4-8, when we got the index to the end of the first word but then cleared the string so our index was invalid? That code was logically incorrect but didn’t show any immediate errors. The problems would show up later if we kept trying to use the first word index with an emptied string. Slices make this bug impossible and let us know we have a problem with our code much sooner. Using the slice version of `first_word` will throw a compile-time error:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s);

    s.clear(); // error!

    println!("the first word is: {word}");
}
```
REASON:-Recall from the borrowing rules that if we have an immutable reference to something, we cannot also take a mutable reference. Because `clear` needs to truncate the `String`, it needs to get a mutable reference. The `println!` after the call to `clear` uses the reference in `word`, so the immutable reference must still be active at that point. Rust disallows the mutable reference in `clear` and the immutable reference in `word` from existing at the same time, and compilation fails. Not only has Rust made our API easier to use, but it has also eliminated an entire class of errors at compile time!
### [Other Slices](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-03-slices.html#other-slices)

String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings. But there’s a more general slice type too. Consider this array:
```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let slice = &a[1..3];

assert_eq!(slice, &[2, 3]);

```
This slice has the type `&[i32]`. It works the same way as string slices do, by storing a reference to the first element and a length. You’ll use this kind of slice for all sorts of other collections. We’ll discuss these collections in detail when we talk about vectors in Chapter 8.
