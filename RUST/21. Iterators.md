Iterators in Rust are a powerful tool for processing collections like arrays, vectors, and other data structures. Rust’s `Iterator` trait provides a way to work with sequences of elements, allowing efficient and expressive looping and transformation of data.

### 1. Basics of Iterators

An iterator is any object that implements the `Iterator` trait, which looks like this:
```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;
    
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}

```
- **`type Item`**: The type of elements the iterator produces.
- **`next()`**: Advances the iterator and returns the next element wrapped in `Option<T>`. When the iterator is finished, `None` is returned.
### 2. Creating an Iterator
```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let mut iter = numbers.iter(); // Creates an iterator

    // Manually using next()
    assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&1));
    assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&2));
    assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&3));
}

```
In most cases, you won’t call `next()` manually. Instead, you can use loops to consume the iterator:
```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    for num in numbers.iter() {
        println!("{}", num);  // Prints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    }
}

```
### 4. Iterator Methods

Rust iterators come with several methods that help with transformation, filtering, and more. Some commonly used methods:

#### 4.1 `map()`

Transforms each element in the iterator.
```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let doubled: Vec<i32> = numbers.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect();
    
    println!("{:?}", doubled);  // Prints [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
}

```
- **`.map()`**: Takes a closure and applies it to each element.
- **`.collect()`**: Consumes the iterator and collects the results into a collection (like a `Vec`).

### Summary of Differences:

- **Rust Iterators**: Lazy, with methods like `map` and `filter` returning new iterators that are only evaluated when consumed.
- **JavaScript Array Iterators**: Eager, immediately applying transformations and returning a new array.
- **Custom Iterators**: Rust uses the `Iterator` trait, while JavaScript defines custom iterators via objects with `next()` methods.
