```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
	 V4,
	 V6,
}
```
IpAddrKind is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our code.

Enum Values We can create instances of each of the two variants of IpAddrKind like this:

```rust
let four = IpAddrKind::V4; 
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
```
Defining a function that takes Enum as input
```rust
fn route(ip_type: IpAddrKind) { }


route(IpAddrKind::V4); 
route(IpAddrKind::V6);
```

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
 V4,
 V6,
}
struct IpAddr {
  kind: IpAddrKind,
  address: String,
}
let home = IpAddr {
 kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
 address: String::from("127.0.0.1"),
};
let loopback = IpAddr {
 kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
 address: String::from("::1"),
};
```

We can represent the same concept in a more concise way using just an enum, rather than an enum inside a struct, by putting data directly into each enum variant. This new definition of the IpAddr enum says that both V4 and V6 variants will have associated String values:

```rust
enum IpAddr {
 V4(String),
 V6(String),
}
let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));
let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```
We attach data to each variant of the enum directly, so there is no need for an extra struct. There’s another advantage to using an enum rather than a struct: each variant can have different types and amounts of associated data. Version four type IP addresses will always have four numeric components that will have values between 0 and 255. If we wanted to store V4 addresses as four u8 values but still express V6 addresses as one String value, we wouldn’t be able to with a struct. Enums handle this case with ease.

```rust
enum IpAddr {
 V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
 V6(String),
}
let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);
let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```
: A Message enum whose variants each store different amounts and types of values
```rust
enum Message {
 Quit,
 Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
 Write(String),
 ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
```
This enum has four variants with different types:
• Quit has no data associated with it at all. 
• Move includes an anonymous struct inside it.
• Write includes a single String.
• ChangeColor includes three i32 values.

Defining an enum with variants such as the ones in Listing 6-2 is similar to defining different kinds of struct definitions, except the enum doesn’t use the struct keyword and all the variants are grouped together under the Message type. The following structs could hold the same data that the preceding enum variants hold:
```rust
struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
struct MoveMessage {
 x: i32,
 y: i32,
}
struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct
```
#note But if we used the different structs, which each have their own type, we
couldn’t as easily define a function to take any of these kinds of messages as
we could with the Message enum defined in Listing 6-2, which is a single type\

# Methods in Enums 

There is one more similarity between enums and structs: just as we’re able to define methods on structs using impl, we’re also able to define methods on enums. Here’s a method named call that we could define on our Message enum:
```rust
enum Message {
 Quit,
 Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
 Write(String),
 ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}


impl Message {
 fn call(&self) {
	// method body would be defined here
 }
}
let m = Message::Write(String::from ("hello"));
m.call();
```
## The Option Enum and Its Advantages over Null Values
In Rust, the `Option<T>` enum is used to handle situations where a value might be present or absent. It is a powerful tool that helps you safely deal with nullable or optional values without introducing null pointer errors (which are common in languages like C++ or JavaScript).
## Option`<T>` Enum
Option`<T>` is the type or enum that represents a value that might or might not exist. It has two variants:

1. Some(T) – Represents the presence of a value (where T is the type of the value).
2. None – Represents the absence of a value.
```rust
let x: Option<i32> = Some(10);  // x is an Option<i32> that holds the value 10
let y: Option<i32> = None;      // y is an Option<i32> that holds no value

```

1. Expressing this concept in terms of the type system means the compiler can check whether you’ve handled all the cases you should be handling;
2. this functionality can prevent bugs that are extremely common in other programming languages.
3. Rust doesn’t have the null feature that many other languages have. Null is a value that means there is no value there. In languages with null, variables can always be in one of two states: null or not-null
4. Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. This enum is Option, and it is defined by the standard library as follows:
```rust
enum Option<T> {
 Some(T),
 None,
}
```
#### explained 
It has two variants:

- Some(T) – Contains a value of type T.
- None – Represents the absence of a value.
The Option`<T> `type is very useful in scenarios where a value might be optional, such as retrieving the value from a collection, opening a file, or parsing input. In many languages, these operations could result in null or undefined, which can lead to runtime errors. In Rust, Option`<T> `forces you to handle the case where a value may or may not exist.


1. The Option enum is so useful that it’s even included in the prelude; you don’t need to bring it into scope explicitly.
2. . In addition, so are its variants: you can use Some and None directly without the Option:: prefix. The Option enum is still just a regular enum, and Some(T) and None are still variants of type Option
3. The syntax is a feature of Rust we haven’t talked about yet. It’s a generic type parameter _For now, all you need to know is that means the Some variant of the Option


# Example implementation
```rust
fn divide(a: i32, b: i32) -> Option<i32> {
    if b == 0 {
        None
    } else {
        Some(a / b)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let result = divide(10, 2);
    match result {
        Some(value) => println!("Result: {}", value),
        None => println!("Division by zero!"),
    }
}

```

## Key Features:
Compile-time Safety: Since Option requires you to handle both Some and None, it prevents common runtime errors like null dereferencing.
Pattern Matching: Rust encourages the use of pattern matching (match statements) to handle Option`<T>`, ensuring you explicitly consider all possibilities (i.e., whether the value exists or not).



Here are some examples of using Option values to hold number types and string types:
```rust
let some_number = Some(5);
let some_string = Some("a string");
let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;
```
1. If we use None rather than Some, we need to tell Rust what type of Option we have, because the compiler can’t infer the type that the Some variant will hold by looking only at a None value.
2. When we have a Some value, we know that a value is present and the value is held within the Some. When we have a None value, in some sense, it means the same thing as null: we don’t have a valid value. So why is having Option any better than having null?


In short, because Option and T (where T can be any type) are different types, the compiler won’t let us use an Option value as if it were definitely a valid value. For example, this code won’t compile because it’s trying to add an i8 to an Option:
```rust
let x: i8 = 5;
let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);
let sum = x + y;
//ERROR: Rust doesn’t understand how to add an i8 and an Option<i8>, because they’re different types. 
```

## The match Control Flow Operator
Rust has an extremely powerful control flow operator called match that allows
you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code
based on which pattern matches. Patterns can be made up of literal values,
variable names, wildcards, and many other things; Chapter 18 covers all the
different kinds of patterns and what they do. The power of match comes from
the expressiveness of the patterns and the fact that the compiler confirms
that all possible cases are handled

## Match: 
let’s use them as an example of using
match! We can write a function that can take an unknown United States coin
and, in a similar way as the counting machine, determine which coin it is
and return its value in cents, as shown here in Listing 6-3.
```rust
enum Coin {
 Penny,
 Nickel,
 Dime,
 Quarter,
}
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u32 {
	 match coin {
		 Coin::Penny => 1,
		 Coin::Nickel => 5,
		 Coin::Dime => 10,
		 Coin::Quarter => 25,
	 }
}
```
there’s a big difference: with _if,_ the expression needs to return a Boolean value, but here, it can be any type
```rust
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u32 {
	 match coin {
		 Coin::Penny => {
			 println!("Lucky penny!");
			 1
		 },
		 Coin::Nickel => 5,
		 Coin::Dime => 10,
		 Coin::Quarter => 25,
 }
}
```
## Patterns That Bind to Values
```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
enum UsState {
	 Alabama,
	 Alaska,
	 // --snip--
}
enum Coin {
	 Penny,
	 Nickel,
	 Dime,
	 Quarter(UsState),
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u32 {
 match coin {
	 Coin::Penny => 1,
	 Coin::Nickel => 5,
	 Coin::Dime => 10,
	 Coin::Quarter(state) => {
		 println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
		 25
	 },
  }
}

```

# The _ Placeholder
Rust also has a pattern we can use when we don’t want to list all possible
values. For example, a u8 can have valid values of 0 through 255. If we only
care about the values 1, 3, 5, and 7, we don’t want to have to list out 0, 2, 4,
6, 8, 9 all the way up to 255. Fortunately, we don’t have to: we can use the
special pattern _ instead:
```rust 
let some_u8_value = Ou8; //from 0 to 255 
match some_u8_value {
	 1 => println!("one"),
	 3 => println!("three"),
	 5 => println!("five"),
	 7 => println!("seven"),
	 _ => (), //if we write this we dont have to write every possibble value.
}
```

## Concise Control Flow with if let
The if let syntax lets you combine if and let into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest. Consider the program in Listing 6-6 that matches on an Option value but only wants to execute code if the value is 3.

```rust
let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);
match some_u8_value {
 Some(3) => println!("three"),
 _ => (),
}
```
We want to do something with the Some(3) match but do nothing with any
other Some`<u8>` value or the None value. To satisfy the match expression, we have
to add _ => () after processing just one variant, which is a lot of boilerplate
code to add.
Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using if let. The following
code behaves the same as the match in Listing 6-6
 ```rust
if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
 println!("three");
}
```

# Good one
Coin enum definition in Listing 6-4, where the Quarter variant also held a
UsState value. If we wanted to count all non-quarter coins we see while also
announcing the state of the quarters, we could do that with a match expression like this:
```rust
let mut count = 0;
match coin {
 Coin::Quarter(state) => println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state),
 _ => count += 1,
}

//same with if let else 

let mut count = 0;
if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
	 println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
} else {
	 count += 1;
}

```
