### [Ownership Rules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#ownership-rules)

First, let’s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we work through the examples that illustrate them:

- Each value in Rust has an _owner_.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

```rust
     {                      // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared
        let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }     // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid





fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                   // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);
               // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{some_string}");
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{some_integer}");
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.




```
 The static datatypes which are allocated in stack are copied by default. but in the dynamic datatypes the ownership is  transferred to other one and the previous owner will have nothing,
 ```rust
 let st:&str = String::from("hello");
 let st2:&str = st1; //now st1 has hello but st has nothing
	//but in static datatypes

let x:u32 = 12;
let y = 12; //they both have 12 value is copied.

//to achive same in dynamic datatypes
let st:&str = String::from("hello");
 let st2:&str = st1.clone() //value is now copied (expensive task)


```
