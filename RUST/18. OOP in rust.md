### Key OOP Concepts in Rust

1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data.
2. **Inheritance**: Sharing behavior between types.
3. **Polymorphism**: Using a unified interface to interact with different types.
4. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details.
### 1. Encapsulation

In Rust, you use `structs` to define your data types. Methods can be associated with these structs using `impl` blocks.

#### Example of Encapsulation
```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    // Constructor
    fn new(width: u32, height: u32) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle { width, height }
    }

    // Method to calculate area
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    // Method to determine if it is a square
    fn is_square(&self) -> bool {
        self.width == self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle::new(10, 20);
    println!("Area: {}", rect.area());
    println!("Is square: {}", rect.is_square());
}

```
### 2. Inheritance

Rust does not have traditional inheritance like C++ or Java. Instead, it encourages composition and code reuse through **traits**.

#### Using Traits for Reusability

```rust
trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

struct Rectangle {
    width: f64,
    height: f64,
}

impl Shape for Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius
    }
}

fn print_area<T: Shape>(shape: &T) {
    println!("Area: {}", shape.area());
}

fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle { width: 10.0, height: 20.0 };
    let circle = Circle { radius: 10.0 };

    print_area(&rect);
    print_area(&circle);
}


```
### 3. Polymorphism

### 1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Dispatch)**

Rust achieves compile-time polymorphism using **generic types** and **traits**. When a generic type is used in conjunction with a trait bound, the Rust compiler will generate specialized code for each concrete type used with the generic.

Example:
 ```rust
 trait Speak {
    fn say(&self);
}

struct Dog;
struct Cat;

impl Speak for Dog {
    fn say(&self) {
        println!("Woof!");
    }
}

impl Speak for Cat {
    fn say(&self) {
        println!("Meow!");
    }
}

fn speak_animal<T: Speak>(animal: T) {
    animal.say();
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    let cat = Cat;

    speak_animal(dog); // Output: Woof!
    speak_animal(cat); // Output: Meow!
}

```

Here, `Speak` is a trait that both `Dog` and `Cat` implement. When `speak_animal` is called, Rust generates code specifically for the `Dog` and `Cat` types. This is **static dispatch** because the method to call is determined at compile time.

### 2. **Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Dispatch)**

For run-time polymorphism, Rust uses **trait objects**. A trait object is a pointer to both an instance of a type and a table of function pointers (vtable) that can be used to call methods dynamically at runtime.

Example:
```rust
trait Speak {
    fn say(&self);
}

struct Dog;
struct Cat;

impl Speak for Dog {
    fn say(&self) {
        println!("Woof!");
    }
}

impl Speak for Cat {
    fn say(&self) {
        println!("Meow!");
    }
}

fn speak_animal(animal: &dyn Speak) {
    animal.say();
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    let cat = Cat;

    speak_animal(&dog); // Output: Woof!
    speak_animal(&cat); // Output: Meow!
}

```

In this case, `speak_animal` accepts a **trait object** `&dyn Speak`. This allows the function to handle any type that implements the `Speak` trait, and the method is dispatched at runtime. This is known as **dynamic dispatch**.

### Key Differences:

- **Static dispatch**: The compiler knows the exact type at compile time and generates code for each specific type (no runtime overhead).
- **Dynamic dispatch**: The type is not known until runtime, so there's some overhead for determining the method to call.

### Conclusion:

- **Traits** are the foundation of polymorphism in Rust.
- Use **generics** for compile-time polymorphism when the types are known in advance.
- Use **trait objects** for dynamic dispatch when you need runtime flexibility.```
### 4. Abstraction

Traits can be used to provide an abstraction layer by defining shared behavior without exposing implementation details.

#### Example of Abstraction
```rust
trait Animal {
    fn make_sound(&self);
}

struct Dog;

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn make_sound(&self) {
        println!("Woof!");
    }
}

struct Cat;

impl Animal for Cat {
    fn make_sound(&self) {
        println!("Meow!");
    }
}

fn animal_sound(animal: &dyn Animal) {
    animal.make_sound();
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    let cat = Cat;

    animal_sound(&dog);
    animal_sound(&cat);
}

```
While Rust does not follow the traditional OOP paradigm, it provides powerful constructs to implement OOP principles. This encourages safer and more efficient code design. By leveraging structs, traits, and methods, you can achieve a similar structure and functionality to that found in more conventional OOP languages.
