Declarative macros in Rust are like templates for code, allowing you to generate repetitive or complex code patterns with a simplified syntax. They are defined using the `macro_rules!` keyword, and they’re useful for tasks like creating small code snippets, defining custom data structures, or handling repetitive patterns in a flexible way.

Here’s a breakdown of how they work and how you can use them:

### 1. Basic Syntax
A declarative macro in Rust begins with `macro_rules!`, followed by the macro’s name and a set of rules. Each rule specifies a pattern to match and a transformation to apply when the pattern is encountered. Here’s an example:

```rust
macro_rules! say_hello {
    () => {
        println!("Hello!");
    };
}
```

In this example:
- `say_hello!` is the macro’s name.
- The pattern `()` indicates that this macro doesn’t take any arguments.
- The transformation part is `println!("Hello!");`, which will execute whenever you call `say_hello!()`.

#### Using the Macro
```rust
fn main() {
    say_hello!(); // Expands to println!("Hello!");
}
```

### 2. Macros with Parameters
You can pass parameters to macros. For instance, here’s a macro that prints a message with a custom input:

```rust
macro_rules! greet {
    ($name:expr) => {
        println!("Hello, {}!", $name);
    };
}
```

Here:
- `$name:expr` is a pattern that matches any Rust expression.
- `println!` will insert the value of `$name` where `{}` appears.

#### Using the Macro
```rust
fn main() {
    greet!("Alice"); // Expands to println!("Hello, Alice!");
}
```

### 3. Pattern Matching and Repetition
Macros can match different patterns and handle repetitions. For instance, you might want to define a macro that can accept multiple items and print each one.

```rust
macro_rules! print_items {
    ($($item:expr),*) => {
        $(
            println!("{}", $item);
        )*
    };
}
```

Here:
- `$($item:expr),*` matches any number of expressions, separated by commas.
- `$()` is a repetition pattern, so for each `item`, `println!("{}", $item);` is expanded.

#### Using the Macro
```rust
fn main() {
    print_items!("apple", "banana", "cherry"); // Prints each item on a new line
}
```

### 4. Using Declarative Macros for Custom Data Structures
Let’s say you want to create a macro that helps define simple enums. You could use a declarative macro to streamline the process.

```rust
macro_rules! create_enum {
    ($name:ident { $($variant:ident),* }) => {
        enum $name {
            $(
                $variant,
            )*
        }
    };
}
```

This macro:
- Accepts an identifier `$name` for the enum’s name.
- Accepts a list of variants, each matched by `$variant`.
- Creates an enum with those variants.

#### Using the Macro
```rust
create_enum!(Fruits { Apple, Banana, Cherry });

fn main() {
    let my_fruit = Fruits::Apple;
}
```

### 5. Advantages of Declarative Macros
- **Flexibility**: They allow you to write highly customizable, reusable code snippets.
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common patterns can be wrapped in macros, reducing boilerplate.
- **Compile-Time Expansion**: Macros are expanded at compile-time, so they don’t impact runtime performance.

### 6. Limitations
- **Complexity**: Macros can be hard to debug since errors in macro expansion aren’t always clear.
- **Syntax Restrictions**: Unlike procedural macros, declarative macros have more restricted syntax patterns.

Let me know if you’d like to see a more advanced example or have specific cases you’d like to use macros for!
### Lets recreate Vec!() macro.
```rust
macro_rules! my_vec {
    //+ means at least one param is needed.
    //if there was * that means it can be empty
    
    ($($x:expr),+) => {
        {
           let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
            $(
                temp_vec.push($x);
            )+
            temp_vec
        }
    }
}

fn main() {

    let mut y:Vec<i32> = my_vec!(1);
    dbg!(y);  
  
}

```
