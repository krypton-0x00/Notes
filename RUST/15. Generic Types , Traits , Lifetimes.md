###### Removing Duplication by Extracting a Function
```rust
fn main() {
	let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
	let mut largest = number_list[0];
	for number in number_list {
		if number > largest {
		largest = number;
   }
 }
 println!("The largest number is {}", largest);
}
```
Although this code works, duplicating code is tedious and error prone. We also have to update the code in multiple places when we want to change it. To eliminate this duplication, we can create an abstraction by defining a function that operates on any list of integers given to it in a parameter. This solution makes our code clearer and lets us express the concept of finding the largest number in a list abstractly. In Listing 10-3, we extracted the code that finds the largest number into a function named largest. Unlike the code in Listing 10-1, which can find the largest number in only one particular list, this program can find the largest number in two different lists.
```rust
fn largest(list: &[i32]) -> i32 {
 let mut largest = list[0];
 for &item in list.iter() {
	 if item > largest {
	 largest = item;
	 }
 }
 largest
}

fn main() {
	 let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
	 let result = largest(&number_list);
	 println!("The largest number is {}", result);
	 let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];
	 let result = largest(&number_list);
	 println!("The largest number is {}", result);
}```
Listing 10-3: Abstracted code to find the largest number in two lists


### Generic Data Types
We can use generics to create definitions for items like function signatures or structs, which we can then use with many different concrete data types.

### In Function Definitions
Continuing with our largest function, Listing 10-4 shows two functions that both find the largest value in a slice.

 ```rust
fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    let mut largest = list[0];
    for &item in list.iter() {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }
    largest
}

fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> char {
    let mut largest = list[0];
    for &item in list.iter() {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }
    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
    let result = largest_i32(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);
    
    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];
    let result = largest_char(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```
Listing 10-4: Two functions that differ only in their names and the types in their signatures

### Fix duplication by generics 

`fn largest(list: &[T]) -> T {`

```rust
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> T {
    let mut largest = list[0];
    for &item in list.iter() {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }
    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);
    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];
    let result = largest(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```
Listing 10-5: A definition of the largest function that uses generic type parameters but doesn’t compile yet
```
error[E0369]: binary operation `>` cannot be applied to type `T`
 --> src/main.rs:5:12
 |
5 | if item > largest {
 | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 |
 = note: an implementation of `std::cmp::PartialOrd` might be missing for `T`
```
. For now, this error states that the body of largest won’t work for all possible types that T could be. Because we want to compare values of type T in the body, we can only use types whose values can be ordered. To enable comparisons, the standard library has the std::cmp::PartialOrd trait that you can implement on types (see Appendix C for more on this trait).

### In Struct Definitions
```rust
struct Point<T>  {
 x: T ,
 y: T ,
}
fn main() {
 let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
 let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
}
```
: A Point struct that holds x and y values of type T
#note It can only have one type at a time eg:
```rust 
struct Point<T> {
 x: T,
 y: T,
}
fn main() {
 let wont_work = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 }; //x is int but 4.0 is float
 //error
}

```

# Fix
To define a Point struct where x and y are both generics but could have different types, we can use multiple generic type parameters. For example, in Listing 10-8, we can change the definition of Point to be generic over types T and U where x is of type T and y is of type U.
```rust
struct Point<T, U> {
 x: T,
 y: U,
}
fn main() {
 let both_integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
 let both_float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
 let integer_and_float = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}
```
A Point generic over two types so that x and y can be values of different types

# In Enum Definitions
```rust
enum Option<T>{
	Some(T),
	None,
}
enum Result<T, E> {
	 Ok(T),
	 Err(E),
}
```
##### In Method Definitions
```rust
struct Point<T> {
 x: T,
 y: T,
}
impl<T> Point<T> {
 fn x(&self) -> &T {
 &self.x
 }
}
fn main() {
 let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
 println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
```
Implementing a method named x on the Point struct that will return a reference to the x field of type T

# Traits: Defining Shared Behavior
A trait tells the Rust compiler about functionality a particular type has and can share with other types. We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way. We can use trait bounds to specify that a generic can be any type that has certain behavior.

__Traits are similar to a feature often called interfaces in other languages, although with some differences.__

Here’s an example of a simple trait in Rust:
```rust
trait Animal {
    fn speak(&self);  // method without default implementation
    fn move_around(&self) {
        // default method implementation
        println!("This animal is moving around.");
    }
}


```
- `speak`: A method that must be implemented by any type that implements the `Animal` trait.
- `move_around`: A method with a default implementation, meaning any type that implements `Animal` can use this as-is or override it.
## ### 3. **Implementing a Trait**
```rust
struct Dog;

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn speak(&self) {
        println!("Woof!");
    }
    // `move_around` is not overridden, so the default implementation will be used
}

```

# 4. **Using Traits**
```rust
fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    dog.speak();          // Outputs: Woof!
    dog.move_around();    // Outputs: This animal is moving around.
}

```

### 5. **Trait Bound and Generics**

Rust allows you to use traits with generics to define behavior for multiple types. For example, let’s say we want to create a function that works with any type that implements `Animal`:
```rust
fn animal_sound<T: Animal>(animal: T) {
    animal.speak();
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    animal_sound(dog);  // Outputs: Woof!
}

```
### 6. **Multiple Traits**

Rust supports **multiple traits** on a type, similar to multiple inheritance in C++. You can have a struct implement multiple traits:

```rust
trait Fly {
    fn fly(&self);
}

struct Bird;

impl Animal for Bird {
    fn speak(&self) {
        println!("Chirp!");
    }
}

impl Fly for Bird {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("Bird is flying!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let bird = Bird;
    bird.speak();    // Outputs: Chirp!
    bird.fly();      // Outputs: Bird is flying!
}

```

### 7. **Trait Objects (Dynamic Dispatch)**

If you need polymorphism (like using an interface in JS or a virtual class in C++), Rust supports **trait objects**. Trait objects allow for **dynamic dispatch** (deciding at runtime which method to call).

Here’s how it works:
```rust
fn make_animal_speak(animal: &dyn Animal) {
    animal.speak();
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    make_animal_speak(&dog);  // Outputs: Woof!
}

```
`&dyn Animal` is a **trait object**. It allows you to pass any type that implements `Animal` and call `speak` dynamically at runtime.

### 8. **Key Differences Between Traits and C++/JS Interfaces**

- **No inheritance**: Rust does not have inheritance like C++ (where classes can inherit from other classes). In Rust, you compose functionality using traits and structs.
- **Static vs. Dynamic dispatch**: By default, trait methods are statically dispatched (like C++ templates). You can opt for dynamic dispatch using trait objects (`dyn Trait`).
- **No virtual functions**: Rust traits replace virtual functions in C++. If you want polymorphic behavior, you explicitly opt into it with trait objects.

### 9. **Traits vs Interfaces (JS/C++ Comparison)**

- **JS:** In JavaScript, objects are flexible, and you don’t declare types explicitly. However, you can think of Rust traits as "interfaces" where the compiler ensures that types implement the required behavior at compile-time.
    
- **C++:** In C++, you may be familiar with abstract classes and pure virtual functions. Traits are more flexible than C++ abstract base classes, as they can provide default implementations, and you can implement multiple traits without the complexity of multiple inheritance.


# Lifetimes in Rust

n Rust, **lifetimes** are a way to express how long references should be valid. They ensure memory safety by preventing dangling references, which occur when you try to use a reference that no longer points to valid data. Lifetimes help the Rust compiler guarantee that references are always valid while keeping the ownership system intact.


### Lifetime Annotations

Lifetimes are written in function signatures using **`'a`** (or other names starting with a single quote). Here's a basic example:
```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

```
#### Explanation:

- **`'a`** is the lifetime annotation. It specifies that the references `x` and `y`, and the return value, must all live for at least as long as lifetime `'a`.
- The function ensures that both `x` and `y` live for at least as long as the returned reference, preventing invalid references.
### Why Do You Need Lifetimes?

Consider this function without lifetimes:
```rust
fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

```
This code would throw an error because the compiler doesn't know how long the references in `x` and `y` are valid. The lifetime annotations tell Rust how long these references should live relative to each other.

### Lifetime Inference

Rust can often infer lifetimes, so you don’t always need to explicitly annotate them. For example:

```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    &s[0..1]
}

```

Here, Rust can automatically infer the lifetimes because there's a clear relationship between the input reference and the output reference.
### Structs with Lifetimes

When you store references in structs, you need to specify lifetimes explicitly, since the struct needs to know how long the data it references will be valid.
```rust
struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str,
}

fn main() {
    let novel = String::from("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.");
    let first_sentence = novel.split('.').next().unwrap();
    let i = ImportantExcerpt {
        part: first_sentence,
    };
}

```
Here, `ImportantExcerpt` holds a reference to `&'a str`, and `i` cannot outlive the `first_sentence` reference.
### Common Lifetime Errors

1. **Dangling References**: Returning a reference to something that doesn’t exist anymore.
```rust
fn dangling_reference() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("Hello");
    &s  // ERROR: `s` does not live long enough
}

```

1. In this example, `s` is created inside the function, and its reference is returned. However, `s` is destroyed when the function ends, making the reference invalid.
    
2. **Mismatched Lifetimes**: Trying to return a reference that outlives the data it refers to.
    

### Lifetime Elision Rules

Rust uses **lifetime elision rules** to reduce the need for explicit annotations. For functions with simple patterns, Rust can infer lifetimes based on the following rules:

1. Each input reference gets its own lifetime parameter.
2. If there's exactly one input reference, its lifetime is assigned to all output references.
3. If there are multiple input references, but one is `&self` or `&mut self`, the lifetime of `self` is assigned to all output references.

Example:
```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    &s[0..1]
}


```
Rust applies the lifetime elision rule and infers this to be:
```rust
fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    &s[0..1]
}

```
