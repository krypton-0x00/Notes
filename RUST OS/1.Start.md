```rust

#![no_std] // don't link the Rust standard library
#![no_main] // disable all Rust-level entry points

use core::panic::PanicInfo;

#[no_mangle] // don't mangle the name of this function
/// this function is the entry point, since the linker looks for a function
    // named `_start` by default
pub extern "C" fn _start()-> !{ 
    loop{}
}
/// This function is called on panic.
#[cfg(not(test))]

TOML
```toml
```toml
[package]
name = "crate_name"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Author Name <author@example.com>"]

# the profile used for `cargo build`
[profile.dev]
panic = "abort" # disable stack unwinding on panic

# the profile used for `cargo build --release`
[profile.release]
panic = "abort" # disable stack unwinding on pan
```
```


By compiling for our host triple, the Rust compiler and the linker assume that there is an underlying operating system such as Linux or Windows that uses the C runtime by default, which causes the linker errors. So, to avoid the linker errors, we can compile for a different environment with no underlying operating system.

TO BUILD
```
```
cargo build --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```


Alternatively, we can compile it for the host system by passing additional linker arguments:
```bash
 
	# Linux
	cargo rustc -- -C link-arg=-nostartfiles
	# Windows
	cargo rustc -- -C link-args="/ENTRY:_start /SUBSYSTEM:console"
	# macOS
	cargo rustc -- -C link-args="-e __start -static -nostartfiles"
	 
```
